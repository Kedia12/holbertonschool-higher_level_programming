# Python - Data Structures: Lists and Tuples

This project is about learning Python **lists** and **tuples**.

- **Lists** are ordered, changeable (mutable) collections. You can add, remove, and modify elements.
- **Tuples** are ordered, unchangeable (immutable) collections. Once created, their values cannot be modified.

The goal is to practice creating lists/tuples, accessing elements with indexes, looping through them, and writing simple functions using these data structures.
