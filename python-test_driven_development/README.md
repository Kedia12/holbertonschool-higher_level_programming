# Python - Test Driven Development

This directory contains exercises for learning **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** in Python using **doctest** and (later) unit testing.

## Learning Goals
- Understand what TDD is and why it’s useful
- Write tests before (and alongside) implementation code
- Use `doctest` to validate expected behavior
- Handle edge cases and type checking properly
- Write clean docstrings that serve as documentation and tests

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No third-party libraries (unless explicitly allowed by a task)
- Files should be executable where required
