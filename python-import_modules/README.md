# Higher Level Programming - Python Projects

This repository contains my Python projects from Holberton School, focusing on:

## Topics Covered
- **Python Functions**
  - Creating and using functions
  - Function prototypes
  - Returning values
- **If / Else Statements**
  - Conditional logic in Python
- **Loops**
  - Using `for` and `while`
- **Importing Modules**
  - Using functions from other files
  - Import syntax (`from module import function`)
  - Organizing code across multiple files

## Project Structure
Each project has its own folder. Examples include:
- `python-hello_world/` : Basic scripts to start with Python
- `python-if_else_loops_functions/` : Exercises with functions, loops, and conditionals
- `python-import_modules/` : Exercises focused on importing functions from other files

## Notes
- Python 3.8 is used for all scripts.
- All files are executable and follow the Holberton School Python style guide (PEP8).
